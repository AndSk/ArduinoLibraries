# ArduinoLibraries

Various useful libraries for the Arduino

## TimeCounter
A library for counting time.

## HPNumberDisplay
A library for controlling HP 5082-7300/7302 numeric indicators. This library should also be able to control
hexadecimal indicators (HP 5080-7340) by using the decimal point as blanking control, but this has not been tested.
